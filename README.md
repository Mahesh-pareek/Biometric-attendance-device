# Biometric Attendance Device with ESP32

This project implements a secure and efficient biometric attendance system using an ESP32 microcontroller. Users authenticate using fingerprint scans, and attendance data is stored locally on a microSD card as well as uploaded to a cloud-based spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets) for easy access and analysis.

## Components

* ESP32-WROOM-32 Microcontroller
* AS608 Fingerprint Sensor
* LCD 16x4 Display
* MicroSD Card Reader Module
* DS1307 Real-Time Clock (RTC)

## Functionalities

* Fingerprint Enrollment: Users can register their fingerprints with the system for future identification.
* Attendance Recording: Upon scanning a registered fingerprint, the system timestamps the event (using the RTC) and creates an attendance record. The record is then:
    * Logged to the local microSD card for redundancy.
    * Uploaded to a cloud-based spreadsheet (optional integration).
* Data Visualization: The LCD can display:
    * Recent attendance records
    * User feedback during enrollment and authentication attempts
* Web-Based Configuration (Optional): A local web server running on the ESP32 allows for configuration through a web interface accessible on a computer or smartphone connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the device. This could involve:
    * Adding/removing users
    * Exporting attendance data from the microSD card to the cloud
    * Setting system parameters (date/time, user management settings)

## Advantages

* Enhanced Security: Fingerprint recognition offers a more secure and tamper-proof method of attendance tracking.
* Data Redundancy: Local storage provides a backup if cloud services are unavailable.
* Flexibility: Cloud integration allows easy data access and analysis from any device with internet access.
* Improved Efficiency: Streamlines the attendance recording process.
* Cost-Effective: Utilizes readily available and relatively inexpensive components.
* Scalability: Potentially scalable to accommodate more users and devices with a central server for larger deployments.


## Getting Started (Placeholder)

Setting up the hardware, software environment, and code for your project. It will cover:

* Installing necessary libraries (Check <a href="">Requirements</a>)
* Wiring the ESP32 to the other components
* Configuring the fingerprint sensor, LCD, RTC, and SD card modules
* Writing code for fingerprint enrollment, attendance recording, data storage, LCD display updates, and optional web-based configuration.
